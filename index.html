                    I studied Mechanical Engineering, through my studies I did not use programming a lot except I learnt some basics about Matlab to solve mathmatical problems. To be Engineer is to be logical & creative, which are needed skills in Web development too. As you know labour market in Jordan is struggling to thrive so considering a career shift into a promising field is going viral these days. thats why I want to be a developer.
